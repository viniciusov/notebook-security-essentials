# notebook-security-essentials
A great wrapper to protect your notebook or other devices from thieves.

## Motivation
If you have an expensive device, such as a notebook, you probably already though: *"What if someone steal me?"*  
Well, in most of the cases you can't do too much more than calling the cops.
But you can think in some ways to prepare your device to send you crucial informations that can show its current location and other thief's personal information.

## About
To acomplish that, I made a small but efficient bash script to handle these required softwares:
- [location-magic](https://github.com/unwiredlabs/location-magic)
- [logkeys](https://github.com/kernc/logkeys)

With these two softwares you can **track your device** and get **whatever information the thief typed** as soon as your device connects to a Wifi network.  

*Picture this: if the thief is dumb enough to buy something using your notebook (type his Credit Card information), you can even buy a BRAND NEW NOTEBOOK with his account! Oh sweet Revenge!!!  
(I don't know if this is legal, but it's very cool, right?)*

## Requirements
In addition to the above softwares, you'll need:
- A Linux OS.
- Pyhton3 with smtplib library.

## Use at your own risk
I'm not the owner of any previously mentioned softwares and I'm not responsible for any law infringements.
